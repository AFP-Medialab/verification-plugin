link_tooltip	<b>What is this?</b></br>The scores displayed in this section give an indication of how reliable the web source listed can be considered to be. Scores range from 0-100.</br></br>In most cases, the source checked for credibility will be the URL domain. In some cases where this is not usefu a more relevant part of the URL has been checked against. In all cases, the full URL and the domain against which the source credibility check was carried on are listed in the form URL : domain-for-check. </br></br><b>How are these calculated?</b></br>Various institutions analyse sources (particularly domains) across the web to evaluate how reliable they are likely to be based on various metrics.</br>Here, datasets assessing web domain reliability have been pulled from some of these institutions including: Decodex, Media Bias/Fact Check, NewsGuard(COVID19) and ReportersLab.</br>Since the metrics or scores from each of these sources do not necessarily overlap and cannot easily be compared, all scores from any given institution are mapped to a single number between 0-100.</br>For any URL, a list of all institutions which gave the relevant domain a score has been listed, along with the (mapped) results they gave.</br>The final result displayed for any domain is the lowest score from the various sources.</br>	Temp	Temp	Temp

assistant_help_1	The weverify toolkit (this plugin) has multiple tools which can help in the verification of content on social networks, designed to help journalists save time and be more efficient in their fact checking tasks.<br>A full list of these tools can be found in the tutorial section of this plugin.<br>Given the multiple tools and services available, the weverify assistant has been designed to guide users to the services available to them given the nature of the content they would like to check.<br><br>	Temp	Temp	Temp
assistant_help_2	<b>How does the assistant work?</b><br>Users can choose to upload their own media to be checked (an image or a video), in which case verification tools on the plugin which support media upload will be listed.<br>An alternative option is to enter a URL which needs verification or fact checking.<br>Once a URL in entered, the assistant attempts to extract any text, images or videos it can find on the page.<br>Any extracted text or media are then used to suggest the potential actions which can be carried out. Currently, there are three major components to this:<ul><li>Text Checks: displaying any text found on the page, and running a selection of post processing/verification tools against it</li><li>Media Checks: displaying any media found on the page, and if selected, giving the list of tools available on the WeVerify plugin to process selected media</li><li>Verification Checks: checks against elements of the URL which do not fall under either text or media, such as the domain of the website </li></ul>More information on each of these can be found in the links below.<br><br>	Temp	Temp	Temp
assistant_help_3	<b>Which URLS are supported?</b><br>Currently, there is dedicated support for links for the following types of URLs:<ul><li>Facebook photo or video posts</li><li>Twitter statuses</li><li>Youtube video links</li><li>Instagram posts</li><li>Tiktok posts</li><li>Dailymotion video links</li><li>Vimeo video links</li><li>Liveleak video links</li></ul> Other generic links can also be entered and the assistant will attempt to retrieve what it can. However, any results (particularly on the extraction of images and text) on generic links may be much more generalised.<br><br>	Temp	Temp	Temp
