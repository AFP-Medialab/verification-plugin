In some cases where this is not usefu a more relevant part of the URL has been checked against. In all cases, the full URL and the domain against which the source credibility check was carried on are listed in the form URL : domain-for-check. </br></br><b>How are these calculated?</b></br>Various institutions analyse sources (particularly domains) across the web to evaluate how reliable they are likely to be based on various metrics.</br>Here, datasets assessing web domain reliability have been pulled from some of these institutions including: Decodex, Media Bias/Fact Check, NewsGuard(COVID19) and ReportersLab.</br>Since the metrics or scores from each of these sources do not necessarily overlap and cannot easily be compared, all scores from any given institution are mapped to a single number between 0-100.</br>For any URL, a list of all institutions which gave the relevant domain a score has been listed, along with the (mapped) results they gave.</br>The final result displayed for any domain is the lowest score from the various sources.</br>	Test	Test
