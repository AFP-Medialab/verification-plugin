title	Twitter Conversation Explorer	Temp	Temp	Temp
description	This tool aims to provide a simply way to explore a Twitter based conversation. From a starting Tweet you can view, and explore, the replies or the parent Tweet. We also automatically classify replies based on whether they support, refute, query, or just comment on a Tweet. We divide the results into two sections; the top half summaries the Tweet you are currently exploring, whilst the bottom half allows you to interactively explore its replies.	Temp	Temp	Temp
description_needs_replies	Note that this tool works best for Tweets with a reasonably large number of replies. Analysis of Tweets with just a small handful, or no, replies is unlikely to be particularly enlightening.	Temp	Temp	Temp

summary_no_replies	No one has replied to this tweet so there is no further analysis we can perform.	Temp	Temp	Temp
summary_replies_processed	We have currently processed ${tweet.number_of_replies.toLocaleString()} replies to the currently selected tweet.	Temp	Temp	Temp
summary_piechart	We automatically assign one of four possible labels to each reply based on how they support, refute, query, or just comment on the Tweet. This pie chart shows the proportion of these labels across all the replies to this Tweet which we have processed so far.	Temp	Temp
summary_histogram_time	Replies clearly don't all happen at once and it's useful to be able to see how the volume of replies, as well as how they relate to the Tweet, changes over time.	Temp	Temp	Temp
summary_histogram_week	This histogram allows you to do both, and initially shows the first week after the selected tweet was published. If replies were posted outside the initial week, then you can adjust the graph to view these, either by dragging the x-axis or, if the replies occur over a very long period, using the range selector shown below the graph.	Temp	Temp	Temp
summary_histogram_day	In this case, however, all the replies occurred on the same day so the pie chart gives a clearer breakdown than a histogram would.	Temp	Temp	Temp

summary_replies_1	This section of the results focuses on the replies to the Tweet you are exploring. Each reply is shown in chronological order. We also automatically classify replies based on whether they support, refute, query, or just comment on a Tweet. This information is used in two ways in this section. Firstly each reply is colour coded to match the automatic labelling (using the same colours as above). Secondly these labels can be used to filter the replies to allow you to focus in on particular types of reply.	Temp	Temp	Temp
summary_replies_2	Replies can also be filtered to show just those containing a hashtag, a user mention, or a URL or image/video. This could, for example, allow you to focus on replies which refute the Tweet and contain a URL or image.	Temp	Temp	Temp
