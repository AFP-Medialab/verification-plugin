You should avoid using it with screenshots scanned images of documents or juxtaposed images that are in fact altered images. More filters are highlighting the same zone more suspicious is that particular area of the image. Please take into account that forensic filters are outlining any digital signal alteration and not only semantically manipulated artefacts (which means false positives are possible). Some complex textures or excess of luminance may also alter the signal without any manipulation intention. Whenever possible use systematically the best image resolution available (even by searching through similarity for higher resolution identical images).", "warning_advanced_tools": "This tool is reserved for journalists fact checkers and researchers; you need to unlock the advanced tools in the upper right corner of the Tools page to apply and use it.", "warning_beta": "Warning: this is an experimental tool under development and may contain bugs or errors.
