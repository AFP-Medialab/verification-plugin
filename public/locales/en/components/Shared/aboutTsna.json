For regular users, queries are limited to the last 15000 tweets. Restrict your query time interval if your inital request exceeds that number. This tool runs on a development server and is NOT intended for large queries.", "aboutsna_count": "Metrics: TwitterSNA provides a cumulative count of tweets, unedited retweets and likes corresponding to your query", "aboutsna_timeline": "Timeline : The first graphic is a timeline displaying the temporal propagation view of your query.

On each day, the timeline highlights a cumulative number of tweets and retweets.", "aboutsna_most_RT": "Most RTs : this pie chart shows the top 20 unedited retweets, corresponding to your query. You can click on each segment to display the corresponding tweets and sort them on each column.", "aboutsna_most_liked": "Most liked : this pie chart shows the top 20 most liked tweets.

Rhombus nodes are verified accounts. Circle nodes are unverified by Twitter. Size and colour of nodes reflects the volume of tweets matching your query. You can click on any account to see the corresponding tweets.", "aboutsna_heatmap": "Heatmap of propagation : the heatmap displays the tweets matching your query on a week diagram. Darker cells show highest activity. By clicking on each cell, you can see the corresponding tweets. This feature may help you to find out bot accounts tweeting periodically or coordinated behaviour to launch a disinformation campaign.", "aboutsna_most_associated_hashtag": "Hashtag graph : this graph outlines the co-reference of hashtags in tweets matching your query and their mutual frequency. By clicking on any hashtag, you can analyse the corresponding tweets.
